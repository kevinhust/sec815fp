# Overview  
This project aims to implement a comprehensive SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system using Splunk Enterprise to achieve centralized monitoring, analysis, and response capabilities for organizational security events. The goal is to enhance overall security posture and effectively identify, warn, and mitigate potential network threats through automated deployment and intelligent threat detection.

# Core Features  
## 1. Rapid Deployment and Stable Operation
- Automated Splunk Enterprise SIEM system deployment using open-source tools (Splunk Operator for Kubernetes)
- High availability and stability configuration
- Monitoring and alerting for system health

## 2. Comprehensive Data Integration  
- Integration of AWS EC2 instance operating system logs and login logs
- AWS cloud service logs integration (CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs)
- Real-time, accurate data ingestion into Splunk SIEM
- Data parsing and normalization

## 3. Effective Threat Detection
- Development and deployment of critical security detection rules
- Brute force attack detection for EC2 instances
- Sensitive root user activity monitoring in AWS cloud environment
- Abnormal resource usage detection

## 4. Rule Validation and Optimization
- Comprehensive testing of created security rules
- Attack scenario simulation for rule effectiveness validation
- Iterative rule optimization to reduce false positives
- Threat identification accuracy improvement

## 5. Enhanced Security Visibility
- Unified security event dashboard
- Real-time security status monitoring
- Data support for incident investigation and response
- Reporting and analytics capabilities
